<h1 id="hotel">Hotel/Accommodations</h1>
<h2>Book a room by Friday, August 12th with our group code to guarantee your room and discounted rate!</h2>
<p>
	Rooms at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/t1yUMLzo8uB2" target="_blank">Hilton Garden Inn Issaquah</a> are available for guests to book any time from September 2-5.
	Through Friday, August 12th, you can use <a href="http://hiltongardeninn.hilton.com/en/gi/groups/personalized/S/SEAISGI-619-20160902/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG" target="_blank">this link</a> or Group Code 619 to book a discounted room in our reserved block. After August 12th, you can still make a reservation, but it will be outside of our block!
</p>
<p>
	Check in time is 3pm. However, the hotel may be able to accommodate early check in. While they cannot guarantee early check in, they'll do their best to make it happen! Guests are more than welcome to come to the hotel early, and if they are unable to issue a room at that time, they can leave their luggage with the front desk.
</p>
<p>
	If you would like to book outside of September 2-5, make your reservation by calling the hotel directly at (425) 837-3600. While you won't be able to get our discounted rate outside of those dates, they will add a note to your reservation you don't have to switch rooms.
